## What makes this _efficient_
Unlike the competition, this module does not perform a full HTTP request, but rather performs an *HTTP HEAD* request in order to receive the headers only.

Only in cases where the server misbehaves ([😮‍💨Amazon😮‍💨](https://stackoverflow.com/q/73413321/606351)) it falls back to good old, but heavy, *HTTP GET*.

Also, there are no dependencies.

## Installation
```bash
npm install resolve-redirects-efficient
```

## Usage
```javascript
import resolveRedirect from 'resolve-redirect-efficient'

resolveRedirect('http://bit.ly/1TCI5N0')
  .then(url => console.log(url))
```

## Credits
This is heavily based on the now defunct [resolve-redirect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resolve-redirect) by [@Cezary](https://github.com/cezary/).
